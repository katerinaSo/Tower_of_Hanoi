# Tower of Hanoi (homework)
"""
   The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas in 1883.
   Numerous myths regarding the ancient and mystical nature of the puzzle
   popped up almost immediately.
   There is a story about an Indian temple in Kashi Vishwanath which contains
   a large room with three time-worn posts in it, surrounded by 64 golden disks.
   Brahmin priests, acting out the command of an ancient prophecy, have been moving
   these disks in accordance with the immutable rules of Brahma since that time.
   The puzzle is therefore also known as the Tower of Brahma puzzle.
   According to the legend, when the last move of the puzzle is completed, the world will end.
   
   If the legend were true, and if the priests were able to move disks at a rate of one per second,
   using the smallest number of moves it would take them (2**64 − 1) seconds ( 2 in power of 64 minus 1)
